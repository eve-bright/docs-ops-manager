:description: describes the process of monitoring a Neo4j Docker container with NOM agent.

Apart from monitoring Neo4j instances running on a host or a virtual machine, an agent can be setup to monitor containerized Neo4j instances.

In this section we will list some of the methods to setup agents to monitor containerized Neo4j instances in standalone and Docker compose deployments. For Kubernetes
deployments of Neo4j instances, checkout xref:addition/kubernetes/index.adoc[this section]
